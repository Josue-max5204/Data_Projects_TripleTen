Project Analysis: Manhattan Vacation Rental Market
In this project, I analyzed Airbnb data to help a client determine which Manhattan neighborhoods and property types offer the strongest investment potential for 
vacation rentals. Using pivot tables, I examined listing popularity through review frequency (a proxy for how often a property is rented) and identified the top 10 
neighborhoods with the highest rental activity over the past 12 months.

The analysis showed a consistent preference for 1-bedroom rentals across all top neighborhoods except Midtown, where studio apartments were the most frequently 
booked. After isolating these high-demand property types, I created a top_listing indicator to flag the most attractive investment candidates.

To estimate revenue, I joined listing data with daily calendar information and calculated revenue earned per night based on adjusted prices and availability. 
Summing 30 days of earnings and annualizing the figure provided a clear comparison of which top listings generated the most income. 
This final revenue-ranked pivot table highlights the best-performing neighborhoods and property sizes, giving the client a data-backed foundation for future 
investment decisions.
